**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

openQuote is a Chrome browser extension designed to help freight brokers calculate spot load quotes. This privacy policy explains how we handle data in our extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or user data.**

openQuote operates entirely locally on your device and does not:

- Collect personally identifiable information
- Access your browsing history or web activity
- Monitor user behavior or interactions
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Store data on remote servers
- Access your location, contacts, or other device information

## Local Data Storage

The extension stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage:

- Your calculator settings (default fuel rates, stop charges, etc.)
- Your preference configurations

This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser data
- Is only used to maintain your preferred calculator settings

## Third-Party Data Sharing

We do not sell, transfer, or share any user data with third parties because we do not collect any user data.

## Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:

- **sidePanel**: Required to display the calculator interface alongside your browsing

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not enable data collection.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no data security risks associated with using openQuote. All calculations and settings remain local to your browser.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any information from users under 13 years of age, as we do not collect any user information at all.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date.
